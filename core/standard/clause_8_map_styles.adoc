== Requirement Class "Map Styles"

=== Overview

[[maps-styles-overview]]

include::requirements/maps/requirements_class_styles.adoc[]

The core of the OGC API - Maps draft specification introduces the possibility of creating a map by assigning a style to a resource (e.g. a collectionId) but does not specify how to declare the styles supported by each collection. Only with the core specification an API instance is only capable to request the `default` style and the client does not know anything about it. This requirement class extents the core requirements by specifying how to declare style names other than `default` that can be used to request maps. The  OGC API - Styles draft specification (also elaborated in Testbed-15) will allow for the retrieval of the complete information about the style or to send new styles to the server.

=== Declaration of conformance classes

==== Response

The conformance page mainly consists of a list of links. OGC API - Common already requires some links.

include::requirements/maps/styles/REQ_conformance-success.adoc[]

In the conformance page (typically in JSON format) the links follow the link schema defined in the OGC API - Common. The following is an example fragment of the response of an OGC API - Maps conformance information page that declares support for the core and the styles extension.

=== Collection
This draft specification includes dependencies on OGC API - Common collection. The response to the operation is extended with the necessary information to formulate a map response for this collection.

==== Collection Links to styles

This extension describes how to provide a list of styles in the collection description.

      }
    ]
  },

    "id": "topographic",

    "links": [
      {
        "href": "https://example.com/api/1.0/styles/topographic?f=sld10",
        "type": "application/vnd.ogc.sld+xml;version=1.0",
        "rel": "stylesheet"
      },

        "type": "application/json",
        "rel": "describedBy"
      }
    ]
  }
]
=================

The mandatory element id can be used as a value for {styleId}.

The optional links element is useful for connecting to an OGC API â€“ Styles implementation that allows for retrieving the styles description.

=== Maps description
The core of the OGC API - Maps draft specification defines `maps` resource that is associated with an operation that contains the necessary information to later formulate a map request for a collection. Nevertheless, the core does not require any mandatory information.This requirement class does not require any mandatory information, but the response of the operation is conditioned by the availability of more than one style per collection.

=== Maps
This OGC API - Maps style draft specification extension does not specify how to retrieve a map, but it does specify two parameters (`transparent` and `bgcolor`) in addition to the `styleId` defined in the core.

==== Operation

==== Parameter styleId
A part from the `default` style value, this extension introduces the values for the styleId that were presented in the `collectionId` definition.

==== Parameter transparent
include::requirements/maps/styles/REQ_mc-transparent-definition.adoc[]

==== Parameter bgcolor
include::requirements/maps/styles/REQ_mc-bgcolor-definition.adoc[]

If the client wants to force an opaque color, apart from defining the appropriate background color it should ensure that the parameter `transparent` is set to `false`. For the formats that reserve a color to define transparency, it still makes sense to combine background color and transparent=true with the purpose of helping the server to select a color that does not interfere with the actual values and colors in the map.
