^|*Recommendation {counter:rec-id}* |*/rec/core/link-relation-type*
^|A |If a legend is available for a style of the map, the server SHOULD advertise it in the style description by providing an extra link with a relation type `rel`=`icon`.
^|B |There can be more than one legend for a style. If a legend is only appropriate for a range of scales, more than one legend links can be included with the optional extra properties "minScaleDenominator" and "maxScaleDenominator" specifying the range of valid scales. If only "maxScaleDenominator" is present the client will assume that this legend is appropriate for any scale denominators above the "maxScaleDenominator". If only "minScaleDenominator" is present the client will assume that this legend is appropriate for any scale denominators below the "minScaleDenominator".
^|C |If a thumbnail is available for a style of the map, the server SHOULD advertise it in the style description by providing an extra link with a relation type `rel`=`preview`
^|D |If one or more style resources are available to apply the style to the map, the server SHOULD advertise them in the style description by providing extra links with a relation type `rel`=`stylesheet`
