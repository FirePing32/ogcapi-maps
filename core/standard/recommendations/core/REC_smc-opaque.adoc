^|*Recommendation {counter:rec-id}* |*/rec/core/opaque*
^|A | The maps description response may include a boolean property `opaque`.
^|B | 'false' means that map data represents geometries or observations that probably do not
completely fill space and the resulting map should mark those parts as `no data. 'true' means map data are mostly or completely opaque.
^|C | If the property is not provided, it should be interpreted as false (the default value)
