=== Evolution from OGC Web Services

OGC Web Service (OWS) standards have historically implemented a Remote-Procedure-Call (RPC) architectural style using Extensible Markup Language (XML) for payloads over HTTP. This was the state-of-the-art when some of the initial versions of OGC Web Services were originally designed in the late 1990s and early 2000s. This architectural style has now a competing RESTful API style that is proposed as an alternative to RPC pattern. A RESTful API style is resource-oriented instead of service-oriented. This draft OGC API - Maps specification defines a Web API that follows this resource-oriented architecture and in particular the W3C/OGC best practices for sharing Spatial Data on the Web, as well as the W3C best practices for sharing Data on the Web.

The draft OGC API - Common specification is the foundation upon which OGC APIs will be built, including this draft OGC API - Maps specification. The draft OGC API – Common specification specifies the common kernel of an API approach to services that follows current resource-oriented architecture practices. This common API is to be extended by resource-specific API standards. This draft specification therefore extends OGC API - Common to support Map resources.

Beside the general alignment with the architecture of the Web (e.g., consistency with HTTP/HTTPS, hypermedia controls), another goal for OGC API standards is modularization. This goal has several facets:

* Clear separation between Core requirements and more advanced capabilities. The draft OGC API – Maps - Part 1: Core specification presents the requirements that are relevant for almost everyone who wants to share or use maps at a fine-grained level. Additional capabilities that several communities are using today will be specified as extensions to the Core API.
* Technologies that change more frequently are decoupled and specified in separate modules ("requirements classes" in OGC terminology). This enables, for example, the use/re-use of new encodings for spatial data or API descriptions.
* Modularization is not just about a single "service". OGC APIs will provide building blocks that can be reused in APIs in general. In other words, a server supporting the OGC API - Maps draft specification should not be seen as a standalone service. Rather it should be viewed as a collection of API building blocks that together implement OGC API - Maps capabilities. A corollary for this is that it should be possible to implement an API that simultaneously conforms to conformance classes from the Features, Coverages, Maps, Tiles, and other future OGC API standards.

This approach intends to support two types of client developers:

* Those that have never heard about OGC. Developers should be able to create a client using the API definition without the need to adopt a specific OGC approach (they no longer need to read how to implement a GetCapabilities, allowing them to focus on the geospatial aspects).
* Those that want to write a "generic" client that can access OGC APIs. In other words, they are not specific to a particular API.

As a result of following a RESTful approach, OGC API implementations are not backwards compatible with OWS implementations per se. However, a design goal is to define OGC APIs in a way that an OGC API interface can be mapped to an OWS implementation (where appropriate). OGC APIs are intended to be simpler and more modern, but still an evolution from the previous versions and their implementations making the transition easy (e.g. by initially implementing facades in front of the current OWS services).

This document provides simple examples throughout the document. The examples are based on a dataset that contains buildings and the API provides access to the datasets via a single feature collection ("buildings") and two encodings: JSON and Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).

=== Relationship to OGC API - Tiles

WMS and WMTS share the concept of a map and the capability to create and distribute maps at a limited resolution and size. In WMS the number of rows and columns can be selected by the user within limits and in WMTS the number of rows and columns of the response is predefined in the tile matrix set.

With time, the concept of a tile has been generalized to other data models such as feature data (some vendors use the expression _vector tiles_) and even to coverage data. This draft specification presents an approach to tiles that can be applied to almost every resource type that returns data representations. If applied in conjunction with the OGC API - Features standard and on top of a feature collection, the expected result is tiled feature data. If applied in conjunction with the OGC API - Maps draft specification and on top of a collection that is transformed into a map by applying a style, the result should be map tiles (usually in PNG or JPEG format). The relationship between the Maps and Tiles capabilities of OGC API - Maps and OGC API - Tiles was illustrated by the OGC Testbed-15 initiative as shown in <<img_CoreAndExtension>>.

NOTE: OGC API - Tiles includes a core specification and extensions for defining tile matrix sets, tiles from more that one collection, multi-tiles and multitiles from more than one collection. An info extension is foreseen but not fully developed. In contrast, OGC API - Maps is only partially described based on Testbed-15 requirements. The Maps API is described only to the extent to allow for map tiles to be created on top of a map created by selecting a collection with style or multiple collections with styles. This draft specification contains a section for retrieving a map of an arbitrary number of rows and columns but is not fully formulated. Other extensions for maps are also foreseen. In the future, the WMS SWG could take this document and complete the missing capabilities.

=== How to approach an OGC API
There are two ways to approach an OGC API.

* Read the landing page, look for links, follow them and discover new links until the desired resource is found
* Read an API definition document that will specify a list of paths to resources.

For the first approach, 'rel' properties identifying link relation types are used to determine the meaning of a relation represented by a link. The following figure illustrates those the links, including others from OGC API - Tiles.

For the second approach, the section <<OpenAPIExamples>> provides some examples of OpenAPI definition documents that enumerate the paths to the necessary resources.

When OGC API - Maps is used along with the OGC API - Tiles specification, the resources listed in <<table_resources_with_tiles>> become available.
