== Requirement Class "Maps Core"

A map distribution of a dataset as a pictorial representation of a dataset or the collections it has been divided in. To create a pictorial representation a style need to be added to the collections. A map can be retrieved by specifying a set of parameters that will determine its resolution (width, height, boundingbox and CRS) or can be retrieved as tiles.

This clause defines the core part of the OGC API Maps that allows defining a representation in the form of a map that cannot be retrieved by itself but by combining it to a tiles extension or a map extension.

To keep it simple it will introduce a mechanism to select styles but it will not develop it by assuming that the service is capable of dealing with a default style.
