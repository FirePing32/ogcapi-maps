== Requirement Class "Tiled data from more than one collection"

In previous clauses we have been discussion about tiles that are produced form one and only one resource. This is achieved by concatenating the tile path to a resource (e.g. a feature collection). This extension discusses about the possibility to combine more than one resource to create a tile. This is achieved by using by adding the tile path to the root of the service.
