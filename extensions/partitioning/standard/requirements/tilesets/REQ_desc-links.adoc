^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/tilesets/desc-links*
^|A |The map metadata SHALL include a `link` with the `href` pointing to a tileset list supported  that presents a tile aspect of this geospatial data resource and with `rel: "tilesets".
^|B |If the API has a mechanism for their maps to expose links to geospatial aspects (e.g. feature items, metadata...), the API SHALL include a `link` with the `href` pointing to the tileset list that presents a tile aspect of this geospatial data resource and with `rel: "tilesets"`.
^|C |The tileset list SHALL be available as a URI that will be composed by two parts: The first part is the URL of the  map resource (e.g. '.../map') followed by the word '/tiles'.
^|D |The map metadata SHALL include a `link` with the `href` pointing to every tileset supported that presents a tile aspect of this geospatial data resource and with `rel: "tileset"`.
^|E |If the API has a mechanism for their maps to expose links to geospatial aspects (e.g. feature collection, landing page,...), the API SHALL include a `link` with the `href` pointing to every tileset supported by the geospatial data resource that presents a tile aspect of this geospatial data resource and with `rel: "tileset"`.
^|F |The tileset SHALL be available as a URI that will be composed by three parts: The first part is the URL of the  map resource (e.g. '.../map') followed by the word '/tiles', and finally followed by the id of the tile matrix set supported.
