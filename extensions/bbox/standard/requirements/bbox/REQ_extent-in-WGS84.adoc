  wgs84SpatialExtent:
    minItems: 1
    type: array
    description: |-
      One or more bounding boxes that describe the spatial extent of the dataset.
      In the Core only a single bounding box is supported. Extensions may support
      additional areas. If multiple areas are provided, the union of the bounding
      boxes describes the spatial extent.
    items:
      maxItems: 6
      minItems: 4
      type: array
      description: |-
        West, south, east, north edges of the bounding box. The coordinates
        are in the coordinate reference system specified in `crs`. By default
        this is WGS 84 longitude/latitude.
      example:
      - - 7.01
        - 50.63
        - 7.22
